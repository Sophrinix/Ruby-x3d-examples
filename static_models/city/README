= Information

This program reads geographic tile information found at 

 http://gis3.oit.ohio.gov/geodata/

and the `sdiv_lot` shape file found in the 2008 AREIS DVD 

 http://www.co.lucas.oh.us/default.asp?RequestedAlias=AREIS

to reproduce an X3D scene where different houses (currently 3 chosen randomly)
replace the locations of real-wold  houses.  The aerial tile photograph of the
tile serves  as the  ground,  while the shape  file is  used to  determine the
positions of the houses.  Everything is controlled by the `scene.yaml` file.

= Usage

Just type

  sh run.sh

= Prerequisites

Aside from the builder gem which is required for the libx3d library, this
project requires the GeoRuby gem. You can install it by typing

 gem install GeoRuby

Or visiting their website at

 http://rubyforge.org/projects/georuby/

= Configuration

The program is controlled by the `scene.yaml` configuration file. In the file
you can configure the following:

* max_building_dim --- dimensions of each house
* geo --- geographic information
 - tile_dir --- the directory containing the tiles
 - tile_name --- the name of the tile
 - shape_dir --- the directory containing the shape file
 - lbox --- the bounding box on the tile
   + left --- the left bounding region of the tile
   + right --- the right bounding region of the tile
   + bottom --- the bottom bounding region of the tile
   + top --- the top bounding region of the tile

= File Description

* buildings --- a directory containing the possible building models
* buildings.rb --- a library that imports all the building models in the building directory
* city.rb --- draws the final scene
* config.rb --- reads the configuration file
* data --- contains the shape file as well as the tiles
* run.sh --- a small script that runs the city.rb file
* scene.yaml --- configuration file
* shapefile.rb --- reads the shape file
* test_shapefiles.rb --- a shapefiles test script
* tile_metadata.rb --- parses the metadata from the tiles
