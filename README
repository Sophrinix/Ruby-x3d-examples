All models are mit licensed and currently copyright of adakkak

Once I start creating new models, I will denote who owns what.

I am comitting to keeping all models under this this project mit, unless explicitly labeled otherwise.

The point of this repo is to show off what Ruby X3D aka Relax3D can do. Since I am turing that into a ruby gem, i didn't want to waste bandwidth and disk storage on packing examples with it.
